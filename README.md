- I can click on any card to unveil the image that is underneath it (change it to visible state). The image will be displayed until I click on a 2nd card

- When I click on the 2nd card:
  - If there is a match, the 2 cards will be eliminated from the game (left in the visible state)
  - If there isnâ€™t a match, the 2 cards will flip back to their original state (hidden state)

- I can go the score page to see my top scores
